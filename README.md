Sales Analysis for an Electronic Stores Using Python Pandas<Br>
In this analysis using Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions.<br> 
About 12 months worth of sales data, this data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.<br>
On this journey I went from Curating the data, to asking important Business Questions and then analysing the dataset to deduct essential Insights for Business Decisons making.<br>
The Process inludes:<br>
 
A.  DATA CLEANING.
In this stage, the tasks are:
1.  To Drop NaN values from DataFrame
2.  To Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)
4.  Once we have cleaned up our data a bit.<br>
 
B.  EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) 
In this section, important business questions related to the data were asked:

I.  What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?<br>
II. What city sold the most product?<br>
III.  What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?<br>
IV. What products are most often sold together?<br>
V.  What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?<br>

In the quest of answering the above business questions I implore different pandas & matplotlib methods.<br>
They include:<br>
1.  Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)<br>
2.  Adding columns<br>
3.  Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)<br>
4.  Using the .apply() method<br>
5.  Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis<br>
6.  Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results<br>
7.  Labeling our graphs<br>
